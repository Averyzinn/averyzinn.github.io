		<p>I am very close with my family and they are the most important people to me! First is my mom, Suzanne, who is a stay at home mom. She graduated from American University with a Bachlor's Degree in Communications. She loves to play tennis, mahjong and try new restaurants in Manhattan.</p>

		<P>Next is my dad, Jeff. My dad is hilarious and loves to makes jokes. He went to Boston University and graduated with a degree in eletrical engineering, then he went on to get an MBA in finance. He now works in finance and loves to travel the world.</P>

		<p>My brother Jacob is a senior at the University of Wisconsin Madison as well. He is double majoring in zoology and anthropology. Post grad he hopes to take a gap year to travel the world before pursing a PhD.</p>

		<P> The last, most important family member is my dog, Elvis. Elvis is a fourteen year-old Cockapoo. He loves to go on long walks in Central Park and eat treats!</P>
